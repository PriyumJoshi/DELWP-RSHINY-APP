FILES
wc2-5 - this contains the raster predictor variables. It is 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim. These variables are commonly used in species distribution modeling. http://worldclim.org/bioclim.

Preprocessing.Rda: File containing relevant R data. Can be used to load in models, libraries, R objects etc..
Monash_sample_VBA: provided DELWP dataset
Preprocessing.Rmd: R notebook containing the code
The .csv files are the merged/cleaned coordinates (from DELWP and Global Biodiversity Information Facility) for all species (from the Preprocessing step)
Functions.R: R script which contain functions we created to prevent repeating code/make modelling and testing easier

SpeciesC_PA.csv:  this file contains the prescene/pseudo-abscene coordinates for all species as well as their reliability:  The unreliable points are psuedo-abscene points generated by the psuedo abscene function in the package spatialEco: https://rdrr.io/cran/spatialEco/man/pseudo.absence.html. Merely used for testing purpoise

Modelling.Rda: R notebook file containing the code
Modelling.pdf: PDF output of the code
